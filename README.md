- 👋 Hi, I’m @P4TTL

- 👀 I’m interested in 

All sorts really, anything tech related from hardware to software. I've been at univeristy for 2 years now part time and learnt a lot through study work whilst
also working full time. Currently i'm playing around with HTML and JavaScript whilst following The Odin Project which is also teaching me about uploading to 
GitHub using git through a Linux VM.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning

Git, GitHub, JavaScript, Linux and HTML
Also plan to learn more Python but time seems to fly by even during lockdowns.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on

Nothing at the minute until i gain more confidence programming with a specific language :)
